                    If your child has good or well controlled asthma, he/she has two symptoms per week or less.
                    These symptoms do not limit normal activity of the child and will rarely wake him/her up at
                    night. The use of relievers, such as short-acting beta-agonists (SABA), is two times per week or
                    less. Also, the lung functioning is normal or near-normal.

                          Swimming is a healthy form of aerobic exercise that children with asthma can participate in. 
                          The air you breathe while swimming is warm and moist preventing any kind of airway irritation. 
                          Swimming also helps improve lung functionality and increases cardiopulmonary fitness. 
                          In fitness level will prevent trigger of asthmatic.

                          Walking is moderate type of physical activity, which strengths lung functionality and assists 
                          in preventing the resistance in breathing experienced by asthmatics. It is important to consider 
                          the pace of walking.The weather conditions need to be taken into consideration as well before plannign 
                          to go.

                          Jogging have a positive impact on lung muscles and cardiovascular fitness. 
                          Participating in jogging/running will help increase maximal breathing reserve which can improve 
                          asthmatic condition over time. Since, jogging can be quite strenuous for a child with asthma.

                          Yoga training can not only help improve your child°Øs asthmatic symptoms but also help relax their body and mind. 
                          Yogic breathing, also known as pranayama, teaches children to use their rib cage, chest, diaphragm, throat, 
                          and nasal cavity to bring oxygen into the body and to release carbon dioxide.
